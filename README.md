# Block 13
_Play Dice Against The Chain_

This repository contains a Vyper-based dice game designed with simplicity and extensibility in mind. The game simulates rolling dice and determines the outcome based on the rolls. Currently, the project is focused on the core game mechanics, with plans to integrate a blockchain-based betting system using Ethereum smart contracts in the future.

## Features

- Simple dice game logic implemented in Vyper.
- ASCII art representation of dice rolls for an enhanced user experience.
- Outcomes of each game are recorded in a JSON file for potential data analysis.
- Future plans include integrating a Solidity smart contract for a betting system.
